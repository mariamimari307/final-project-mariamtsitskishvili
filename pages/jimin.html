						<p class="he">Park Ji-min, known mononymously as Jimin, is a South 
							Korean singer and dancer. In 2013, he made his debut as a member 
							of the South Korean boy band BTS, under the record label Big Hit 
							Entertainment.</p>
						<p class="he">Park Ji-min was born on October 13, 1995, in Geumjeong 
							District, Busan, South Korea. His immediate family includes his 
							mother, father, and younger brother. When he was a child, he 
							attended Busan's Hodong Elementary School and Yonsan Middle School. 
							In middle school, he attended Just Dance Academy, where he learned 
							popping and locking. Prior to becoming a trainee, Jimin studied 
							contemporary dance at Busan High School of Arts and was a top student 
							in the modern dance department. A teacher suggested that he join an 
							entertainment company, leading him to Big Hit Entertainment. Once he 
							passed the auditions in 2012, he transferred to Korean Arts High School, 
							graduating in 2014.</p>
						<p class="he">Jimin graduated from Global Cyber University in August 2020
							 with a major in Broadcasting and Entertainment. As of 2021, he is 
							 enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University, pursuing a Master of Business 
							 Administration in Advertising and Media.</p>
						<p class="he">Jimin has released three solo tracks under BTS' name—"Lie" 
							in 2016, "Serendipity" in 2017, and "Filter" in 2020—all of which have 
							charted on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. Jimin released his debut 
							solo album, Face in 2023. It debuted at number one in South Korea and 
							Japan, and number two in the United States, while its second single, 
							"Like Crazy", debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, making 
							him the highest-charting Korean solo artist in history on the Billboard 
							200 and the Hot 100 at the time, and the first to debut atop the latter. 
							He is one of singers in “Fast X” soundtrack “Angel pt1”.</p>
