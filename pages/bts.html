						<p class="he">Bts also known as the Bangtan Boys, 
                            is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. 
                            The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, 
                            V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce much 
                            of their material.
                        </p>
                        <p class="he">
                            BTS stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan, 
                            which translates literally to 'Bulletproof Boy Scouts'. 
                            According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's 
                            desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations 
                            that aim on adolescents like bullets". In July 2017, BTS 
                            announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the 
                            Scene" as part of their new brand identity. This extended the 
                            meaning of their name to encompass the idea of growth "from a 
                            boy to an adult who opens the doors that are facing forward".
                        </p>
                        <p class="he">
                            The group has a large, highly organized, online community 
                            of fans known as ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), 
                            which translates the group's lyrics and social media posts into 
                            other languages and matches charitable contributions of BTS's members.
                        </p>

                            BTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment with the single album 
                            2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language 
                            studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. As of 2023, 
                            BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history according to the 
                            Circle Chart, having sold in excess of 40 million albums. Their studio 
                            album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in 
                            South Korea, as well as the first in the country to surpass both four and 
                            five million registered sales. They are the first non-English-speaking and 
                            Asian act to sell out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl 
                            (Love Yourself World Tour, 2019), and were named the International Federation 
                            of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for 
                            both 2020 and 2021.
