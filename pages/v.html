						<p class="he">Kim Tae-hyung, also known professionally as V, 
							is a South Korean singer and a member of the boy band BTS.</p>
						<p class="he">V was born on December 30, 1995, in the Seo District 
							of Daegu, and grew up in Geochang County. He is the eldest of 
							three children, with a younger brother and sister. V first aspired 
							to be a professional singer in elementary school. With his father's 
							support, he began taking saxophone lessons in early middle school 
							as a means of pursuing a musical career. V eventually became a 
							trainee for Big Hit Entertainment after passing an audition in Daegu.</p>
						<p class="he">After graduating from Korean Arts High School in 2014, V 
							enrolled in Global Cyber University, graduating in August 2020 with a 
							major in Broadcasting and Entertainment. As of 2021, he is enrolled 
							at Hanyang Cyber University, pursuing a Master of Business 
							Administration in Advertising and Media.</p>
						<p class="he">Since his debut with the group in 2013, V has released three 
							solo tracks under their name—"Stigma" in 2016, "Singularity" in 2018, 
							and "Inner Child" in 2020—all of which charted on South Korea's Gaon 
							Digital Chart. He appeared on the soundtrack for the television series 
							Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth in 2016 and released his first independent 
							song, the self-composed "Scenery", in 2019.</p>
