						<p class="he">Jung Ho-seok, better known by his stage name J-Hope, 
							is a South Korean rapper, singer-songwriter, dancer, and record 
							producer. He made his debut as a member of South Korean boy band 
							BTS in 2013, under Big Hit Entertainment.</p>
						<p class="he">J-Hope was born Jung Ho-seok on February 18, 1994, in 
							Gwangju, South Korea, where he lived with his parents and older 
							sister, Jung Ji-woo.</p>
						<p class="he">In March 2019, J-Hope enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University 
							for the Master of Business Administration program in Advertising and 
							Media. He previously graduated from Global Cyber University with a 
							degree in Broadcasting and Entertainment.</p>
						<p class="he">J-Hope released his first solo mixtape, Hope World, in 2018. 
							It was received positively by critics and peaked at number 38 on the 
							US Billboard 200, the highest-charting album by a Korean solo artist at 
							the time. He became the first member of BTS to enter the Billboard Hot 
							100 as a soloist in 2019, when his single "Chicken Noodle Soup", featuring 
							singer Becky G, debuted at number 81. In 2022, J-Hope released his debut 
							studio album Jack in the Box. In 2023, he released his single "On the Street" 
							with J. Cole. Now he is in military service.</p>
						<p class="he">His stage name, J-Hope, comes from his desire to represent hope 
							for fans, as well as to be "the hope of BTS". It is also a reference to the 
							myth of Pandora's box, as after the box was opened and all the evils inside 
							were released to the world, the only thing left was hope.</p>
