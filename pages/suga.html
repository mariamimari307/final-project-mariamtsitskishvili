						<p class="he">Min Yoon-gi, known professionally by his stage names 
							Suga and Agust D, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter and record 
							producer. Under Big Hit Entertainment, he debuted as a member of 
							the South Korean boy band BTS in 2013.</p>
						<p class="he">Min Yoon-gi was born on March 9, 1993, in Daegu, South 
							Korea. The younger of two sons, he attended Taejeon Elementary 
							School, Gwaneum Middle School, and Apgujeong High School.</p>
						<p class="he">In March 2019, after graduating from the Global Cyber 
							University with a degree in Broadcasting and Entertainment, he 
							enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University for the Master of Business 
							Administration program in Advertising and Media.</p>
						<p class="he">Suga released his debut solo album, D-Day, in 2023. 
							It debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, tying him with 
							BTS bandmate Jimin as the highest-charting South Korean solo artists 
							of all time. A full member of the Korea Music Copyright Association, 
							Suga has songwriting and production credits on over 150 songs, 
							including Suran's "Wine", which peaked at number two on the Gaon Music 
							Chart and won Best R&B at the 2017 Melon Music Awards. Now he is having 
							solo concerts almost all around the world.</p>
						<p class="he">The stage name Suga is derived from the first syllables of 
							the term shooting guard, the position he played in basketball as a 
							student. He adopted the alias Agust D in 2016 for his mixtape, which 
							is derived from the initials DT for his birthplace, Daegu Town, and 
							"Suga", spelled backwards. He is rapper who can't be beaten in rap.</p>
						<p class="he">His songs are mostly about himself. For example "Amygdala" 
							is about his accident when he was delivery guy and that song showes how
							he get through all of this. </p>
