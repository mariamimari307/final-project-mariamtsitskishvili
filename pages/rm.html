						<p class="he">Kim Nam-joon, known professionally as RM 
							(formerly Rap Monster), is a South Korean rapper, 
							songwriter, and record producer. He is the leader 
							of South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
						<p class="he">Kim Nam-joon was born on September 12, 1994, 
							in Dongjak District, Seoul, South Korea and grew up in 
							Ilsan District, Goyang, where his family moved when he 
							was aged four or five. He has a younger sister. As a child, 
							RM largely learned English by watching the American Sitcom 
							Friends with his mother. As a student, he actively wrote 
							poetry and often received awards for his writing. He posted 
							his work to an online poetry website for roughly one year, 
							where he received moderate attention. As a result, RM expressed 
							interest in pursuing a literary career but later decided against 
							it. When he was twelve years old, he studied in New Zealand for 
							four months. As a student, RM had an IQ of 148 and scored in the 
							top 1% of the nation in the university entrance examinations for 
							language, math, foreign language and social studies. In March 2019, 
							after graduating from Global Cyber University with a degree in 
							Broadcasting and Entertainment, RM enrolled at Hanyang Cyber 
							University's Master of Business Administration program in Advertising 
							and Media.</p>
						<p class="he">RM released his first solo mixtape, RM, in 2015, 
							followed by his second mixtape, Mono, in 2018. The latter 
							became the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in the 
							United States in history when it peaked at number 26 on the 
							Billboard 200. RM made his official solo debut in 2022 with 
							the release of his studio album Indigo, which featured 
							contributions from Erykah Badu and Anderson .Paak. The album 
							peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, becoming the 
							highest-charting album by a Korean soloist of all-time. He has 
							also collaborated with artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, 
							Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X.</p>
