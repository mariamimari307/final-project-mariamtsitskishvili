						<p class="he">Jeon Jung-kook, known mononymously as Jungkook, is 
							a South Korean singer. He is a member and vocalist of the 
							South Korean boy band BTS. He is youngest in BTS and is named 
							“Golden Maknae”.</p>
						<p class="he">Jeon Jung-kook was born on September 1, 1997, in Busan, 
							South Korea. His family consists of his parents and an elder brother. 
							He attended Baekyang Elementary and Middle School in Busan. When 
							he became a trainee, he transferred to Singu Middle School in Seoul. 
							Jungkook initially had dreams of becoming a badminton player when he 
							was younger, but after seeing G-Dragon perform "Heartbreaker" on television, 
							it influenced him to want to become a singer.</p>
						<p class="he">He graduated from School of Performing Arts Seoul, an arts high 
							school, in 2017. In November 2016, he decided to forgo taking the CSATs, 
							Korea's nationwide university entrance exam. In March 2022, he received his 
							degree from Global Cyber University's Department of Broadcasting and 
							Entertainment. He was awarded the President's Award, the school's highest honor.</p>
						<p class="he">Jungkook has performed three solo songs as part of BTS' discography—"Begin" 
							in 2016, "Euphoria" in 2018, and "My Time" in 2020—all of which charted on 
							South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. He also recorded the soundtrack song "Stay 
							Alive" for the BTS-based webtoon 7Fates: Chakho. In 2022, he featured on 
							American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth's single "Left and Right", which 
							peaked at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Later that year, he became 
							the first South Korean artist to release an official song for the FIFA World 
							Cup soundtrack with "Dreamers", which he subsequently performed at the 2022 
							FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony. In 2023, Jungkook released his debut solo 
							single "Seven" featuring Latto, which simultaneously debuted at number one 
							on the Billboard Hot 100, the Global 200, and the Global Excl. US charts, 
							making him the first Korean solo artist to do so. It also became the fastest 
							song in Spotify history to surpass 100 million streams on the platform.</p>
