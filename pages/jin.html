						<p class="he">Kim Seok-jin, also known professionally as Jin, 
							is a South Korean singer, songwriter, and member of the 
							South Korean boy band BTS. Jin has co-written and released 
							three solo tracks with BTS. He made his official debut as a 
							solo artist in October 2022, with the release of the single 
							"The Astronaut".</p>
						<p class="he">Kim Seok-jin was born on December 4, 1992, in Anyang, 
							Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. His family consists of his mother, 
							father, and older brother. In 2007, he went to a study camp 
							in Australia to learn English.</p>
						<p class="he">Jin originally wanted to be a journalist but decided to 
							pursue acting after watching Kim Nam-gil in Queen Seondeok. While 
							in junior high school, he was scouted by South Korean K-pop agency 
							SM Entertainment off the street, but rejected the offer at the time. 
							Initially intending to be an actor, Jin attended Konkuk University and 
							graduated with a degree in Film Studies on February 22, 2017. He later 
							enrolled in graduate school at Hanyang Cyber University to pursue 
							studies in areas other than music.</p>
						<p class="he">Apart from singing, Jin appeared as a host on multiple 
							South Korean music programs from 2016 to 2018. In 2018, he was 
							awarded the fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit by the 
							President of South Korea along with his bandmates for his 
							contributions to Korean culture. Now he is in military service.</p>
